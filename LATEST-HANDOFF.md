# WHERE I STOPPED — 2026-09-28 ~19:40 UTC (branch claude/war-empire-phase-7-toqwff)

**What I was doing:** shipping the army despawn fix (fix round r1), plus review rounds for the capture, harbor and faces fixes, and building the Part-made vehicle bodies (VKIT). The owner asked me to stop, so all workflows are stopped and nothing is scheduled.

**Finished and pushed (live-ready):**
- `af4c7d4`: ground vehicles can't drive on water.
- `4d26673`: army escorts shoot back at the bank, with tracers (owner-only rollout).
- `4e07fc2`: the owner's jet on the four jet keys, pilot inside, Ride on the Trainer.

**Left (all saved as patches in `handoff/wip/`; not built, not live; the table in `handoff/wip/README.md` gives each base and status):**
1. Army despawn fix: finish r1, re-measure, gates, review, ship (`01`).
2. Plaza capture fix (`02`), then army lane B checkpoints (`03`, rebase after 02).
3. Army lane A, guard and follow (`04`): finish tests and rebase onto the shipped `01`. Lane C (ATTACK marches to checkpoints) is not started.
4. Harbor boat and dock (`05`), faces (`06`) and air fix-2 (`08`): each is waiting for its review round.
5. VKIT vehicle bodies (`09`–`12`): ground fix-2 and naval deliverables are half-done. ground2 records (`07`) wait on VKIT ground.
6. Water Lows: land spot behind walls, rider teleport prefetch, hover above 160 studs, shallow reverse.
7. Owner questions:
   - Should the Strike, CAS and Stealth jets get his jet?
   - Is the jet's look OK?
   - Should each jet get its own colour?
   - Should the runway and hangar be bigger?
   - Should the Bridge Layer be amphibious?
   - He needs to pick a new helicopter model: the uploader made every part, 35 parts or fewer.

**Files:** `handoff/wip/*.patch` (12 lanes, plus 03b/04b base patches), `handoff/wip/README.md` and `handoff/wip/notes/` (phone tests, owner texts, assumptions and the army design spec).
**Owner phone test right now:** nothing new. `src/` is unchanged since 4e07fc2.

# LATEST HANDOFF — Code Bot Roblox replacement (20 Sep 2026 ~00:00 Madrid)

Shaun created you because the previous Code Bot Roblox chat **wedged** (messages failed to send). You replace it. Code/GitHub/laptop Studio are intact.

## Read first
1. `/workspace/war-empire/HANDOFF-TO-NEW-CODE-BOT.md` — MASTER SYSTEM INSTRUCTION + WAR EMPIRE brief
2. `/workspace/war-empire/MASTER_BUILD_SPEC.md`
3. `/workspace/war-empire/ASSUMPTIONS.md`
4. This file

Save operating rules to agent memory (profile): build don’t tutor; COMPLETED/FILES/TESTING/NEXT; local iteration; push to https://github.com/shaunbirrell/war-empire; ask only when architecture-breaking.

## Repo / branch
- Remote: https://github.com/shaunbirrell/war-empire
- Working branch: **`phase-7-polish`** (latest commit at handoff: **`b009165`** — BUY bootstrap fix)
- Earlier PRs: #1 phase-3-combat, #2 phase-5-territory, #3 phase-7-polish (may need refresh)
- Local: `/workspace/war-empire`
- Place builds: `dist/WarEmpire.rbxlx`, `dist/WarEmpire-PERF.rbxlx`
- Shaun’s laptop: `C:\Users\laura\Downloads\WarEmpire-PERF.rbxlx` (machineId `be2ced83-f720-49b1-a3c0-1100e04ffc10` — Lara’s Windows laptop used for Studio)

## What the previous bot was doing (transcript summary)

### Product progress
Phases 1–7+ heavily expanded beyond MVP:
- Foundation, tycoon, combat, vehicles, territory, missions, monetization, tutorial, battle pass, clans, seasons, soldiers, bank raids, spinner, upgrade pads, desert map restyle, bank guards AI, mobile HUD, perf cuts, void/fall safety, world prompts / BUY pads

### Critical live bug (LAST FOCUS — claimed fixed, needs Shaun confirm)
**Command Center BUY broken in Studio Play:**
1. `CombatService/init.luau` required `VisualAssetService` via wrong path (`script.Parent.Parent` → Server), crashing Bootstrap
2. Crash happened **before** remotes finished → client error `RemoteEvent missing: SpinnerStateUpdate`
3. HUDController died → WorldPromptController never inited → no BUY button

**Fix shipped in `b009165`:**
- Correct require → `script.Parent.VisualAssetService`
- `RemoteSetup.Init()` early + idempotent
- UIController `safeInit` pcall so WorldPrompt always runs
- Rebuilt rbxlx; copied to laptop Downloads as `WarEmpire-PERF.rbxlx`

**Shaun was asked to:** Stop Play → open new Downloads file → Play → stand on Command Center → expect gold BUY + walk-buy; cash $5000 → $3500. **He has not confirmed yet** (chat wedged).

### Other open work from previous todos
- Verify BUY + all dock/buttons end-to-end
- Playtest on laptop Studio until solid
- Studio/Creator assets for soldiers/guards/buildings/vehicles (in progress / cancelled stick approach)
- Overnight polish / MVP completion pass

### Git commit tip
Do **not** write `git config`. Use env:
```
export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Code Bot Roblox"
export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="codebot@war-empire.local"
export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```

### Shaun prefs
- Speed: keep chaining, local executors over Cloud Agents
- Copy rbxlx to his laptop Downloads when shipping playtest builds
- Roblox username seen in logs: `shaunie6`
- Spanish Windows path (`El sistema no puede encontrar…`) — laptop is Spanish locale

## Immediate job
1. Message Shaun: you’re the new Code Bot, online, you have the handoff.
2. Confirm `git log -1` on `phase-7-polish` is `b009165` or newer; pull if needed.
3. Ask if BUY works on the latest `WarEmpire-PERF.rbxlx`; if not, diagnose from Studio Output and fix.
4. Continue polish: buttons, playtest, assets — COMPLETED/FILES/TESTING/NEXT format.

Chief of Staff may ping you; Shaun’s chat is primary.
