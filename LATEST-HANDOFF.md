# LATEST HANDOFF — Code Bot Roblox replacement (20 Sep 2026 ~00:00 Madrid)

Shaun created you because the previous Code Bot Roblox chat **wedged** (messages failed to send). You replace it. Code/GitHub/laptop Studio are intact.

## Read first
1. `/workspace/war-empire/HANDOFF-TO-NEW-CODE-BOT.md` — MASTER SYSTEM INSTRUCTION + WAR EMPIRE brief
2. `/workspace/war-empire/MASTER_BUILD_SPEC.md`
3. `/workspace/war-empire/ASSUMPTIONS.md`
4. This file

Save operating rules to agent memory (profile): build don’t tutor; COMPLETED/FILES/TESTING/NEXT; local iteration; push to https://github.com/shaunbirrell/war-empire; ask only when architecture-breaking.

## Repo / branch
- Remote: https://github.com/shaunbirrell/war-empire
- Working branch: **`phase-7-polish`** (latest commit at handoff: **`b009165`** — BUY bootstrap fix)
- Earlier PRs: #1 phase-3-combat, #2 phase-5-territory, #3 phase-7-polish (may need refresh)
- Local: `/workspace/war-empire`
- Place builds: `dist/WarEmpire.rbxlx`, `dist/WarEmpire-PERF.rbxlx`
- Shaun’s laptop: `C:\Users\laura\Downloads\WarEmpire-PERF.rbxlx` (machineId `be2ced83-f720-49b1-a3c0-1100e04ffc10` — Lara’s Windows laptop used for Studio)

## What the previous bot was doing (transcript summary)

### Product progress
Phases 1–7+ heavily expanded beyond MVP:
- Foundation, tycoon, combat, vehicles, territory, missions, monetization, tutorial, battle pass, clans, seasons, soldiers, bank raids, spinner, upgrade pads, desert map restyle, bank guards AI, mobile HUD, perf cuts, void/fall safety, world prompts / BUY pads

### Critical live bug (LAST FOCUS — claimed fixed, needs Shaun confirm)
**Command Center BUY broken in Studio Play:**
1. `CombatService/init.luau` required `VisualAssetService` via wrong path (`script.Parent.Parent` → Server), crashing Bootstrap
2. Crash happened **before** remotes finished → client error `RemoteEvent missing: SpinnerStateUpdate`
3. HUDController died → WorldPromptController never inited → no BUY button

**Fix shipped in `b009165`:**
- Correct require → `script.Parent.VisualAssetService`
- `RemoteSetup.Init()` early + idempotent
- UIController `safeInit` pcall so WorldPrompt always runs
- Rebuilt rbxlx; copied to laptop Downloads as `WarEmpire-PERF.rbxlx`

**Shaun was asked to:** Stop Play → open new Downloads file → Play → stand on Command Center → expect gold BUY + walk-buy; cash $5000 → $3500. **He has not confirmed yet** (chat wedged).

### Other open work from previous todos
- Verify BUY + all dock/buttons end-to-end
- Playtest on laptop Studio until solid
- Studio/Creator assets for soldiers/guards/buildings/vehicles (in progress / cancelled stick approach)
- Overnight polish / MVP completion pass

### Git commit tip
Do **not** write `git config`. Use env:
```
export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Code Bot Roblox"
export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="codebot@war-empire.local"
export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
```

### Shaun prefs
- Speed: keep chaining, local executors over Cloud Agents
- Copy rbxlx to his laptop Downloads when shipping playtest builds
- Roblox username seen in logs: `shaunie6`
- Spanish Windows path (`El sistema no puede encontrar…`) — laptop is Spanish locale

## Immediate job
1. Message Shaun: you’re the new Code Bot, online, you have the handoff.
2. Confirm `git log -1` on `phase-7-polish` is `b009165` or newer; pull if needed.
3. Ask if BUY works on the latest `WarEmpire-PERF.rbxlx`; if not, diagnose from Studio Output and fix.
4. Continue polish: buttons, playtest, assets — COMPLETED/FILES/TESTING/NEXT format.

Chief of Staff may ping you; Shaun’s chat is primary.
